# ## Shore Station Compliance Checker Script
# 
# The IOOS Compliance Checker is a Python-based tool that helps users check the meta data compliance of a netCDF file. This software can be run in a web interface here: https://data.ioos.us/compliance/index.html The checker can also be run as a Python tool either on the command line or in a Python script.  This notebook demonstrates the python usage of the Compliance Checker.
# 
# 
# ### Purpose: 
# Run the compliance checker python tool on a Scipps Pier shore station dataset to check for the metadata compliance.
# 
# The Scripps Pier automated shore station operated by Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) is mounted at a nominal depth of 5 meters MLLW. The instrument package includes a Seabird SBE 16plus SEACAT Conductivity, Temperature, and Pressure recorder, and a Seapoint Chlorophyll Fluorometer with a 0-50 ug/L gain setting.
# 
# ### Dependencies: 
# This script must be run in the "IOOS" environment for the compliance checker to work properly.

# ### Running Compliance Checker on the Scripps Pier shore station data
# This code is written with all the arguments spelled out, following the usage instructions on the README section of compliance checker github page: https://github.com/ioos/compliance-checker

# This Compliance Checker Report can be used to identify where file meta data can be improved.  A strong meta data record allows for greater utility of the data for a broader audience of data analysts.
