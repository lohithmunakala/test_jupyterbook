# test_jupyterbook
This is test repo for hosting IOOS JupyterBook website. 

To build it locally, 

1. Install jupyter-book using the following command.

    ```pip install -U jupyter-book```
2. Clone the repo

    ```https://github.com/lohithmunakala/test_jupyterbook.git```
3. Build the webiste. This should be run outside the folder. In this case, we need to be relative to test_jupyterbook.

    ```jupyter-book build test_jupyterbook```

The website can be checked [here](https://lohithmunakala.github.io/test_jupyterbook) and is still under development. 

Need to add new formats for toc as the old one is redundant at this point.
